# Covid-19-Detection-Through-X-Ray-Images-Using-Deep-Learning
The basic aim of this project is to create a model that can predict whether a particular chest x-ray image of person given is infected with covid19 or not. The proposed model trained have give the accuracy of 97.84% with precision of 99.11%, sensitivity of 96.55% and f1 score of 97.81%.
